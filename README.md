# sudokuSolver

This was my final project to an introductory CS class. The only instructions were to make a sudoku solver and make it fast, so I went crazy.

Note that the input-output part was provided and I only wrote the actual solving part.

## Usage

Give the name of the sudoku file as an argument, or it would otherwise read from stdin. A set of example puzzles can be found in the `puzzles` folder.
