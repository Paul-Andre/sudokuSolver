# sudokuSolver

I made this for a class project. The input and output functions were given. I only had to write the actual solving algorithm.

It contains at least three different techniques used to optimize the solving and I'm quite proud of it.

When running the solver, give the name of the sudoku file as an argument. Otherwise it would read from stdin. A set of example puzzles is provided.
